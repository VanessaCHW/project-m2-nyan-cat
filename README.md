# Introduction

This game was created as a Javascript project for the Full-Stack Web bootcamp from Concordia University, where each student had to debug and add functionnalities to a provided 'broken' game.

# The game

The goal of **Snowfight Escape** is to dodge the enemy's snowballs and accumulate as much points as possible. 

The user uses the arrows to navigate and starts with 5 lives.

**Items** will randomly pop and either restore +1 health (hot chocolate) or grant 100 points (snowman).

## Improvements

- Added background music and sound effects when hit or when an item is found.
- Added a 'shaking' animation on the player when he is hit.
- Added a start and restart page.
